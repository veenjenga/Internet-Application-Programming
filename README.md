ASSIGNMENT 1
create JS to
accomplish the following:
• query for the submit button and input task field once in the beginning and store those
two values in the variables submit and newTask.
• disable the submit button by default. Enable/disable by setting its disabled attribute to
false/true.
• Listen for input to be typed into the input field
• Listen for submission of form
• Find the task the user just submitted
• Create a list item for the new task and add the task to it
• Add new element to our unordered list
• At the end of the script, add the line return false. This prevents the default submission of
the form which involves either reloading the current page or redirecting to a new one.
Note: create HTML elements using the createElement function. Add the elements to the
DOM using the append function.
